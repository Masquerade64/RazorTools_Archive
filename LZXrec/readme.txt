LZX Precompressor (Side project)

Hi guys. First of, I should have called this ziprec and that it deals with xcompress streams, I have zero knowledge when it comes to the difference between lzx and xmemcompress so I just called it lzxrec.

This tool currently only works for zip files compressed with this method, which is why I did mention that I should have called it ziprec but I do have plans for this in future so it ends up supporting for stuff other than zip files.

As for the games that this would currently work on, well for now Forza Motorsport 7.
Other titles that use the same algorithm will be supported, I was working on Project CARS which also uses this method and it looks promising

Anyways, enough about that. Here's part of results for that ridiculously large game.

Forza Motorsport 7\AppFiles\media\pcfamily\cars:

Compressed 987 files, 12,965,446,345 => 29,281,263,518 bytes. Ratio 225.84%
