Hi guys, here's another tool and to be honest, I have no idea if this thing works properly, I don't have space on my PC and I don't want to start deleting stuff without proper inspection as to what is important and what isn't.

Anyways enough about that, I did run a single test on the first 200mb of Resident Evil 2 of that massive pak file it has and this was the result:

Compressed 1 file, 209,715,200 => 390,911,469 bytes. Ratio 186.40%
Compression time: cpu 0.38 sec/real 10.11 sec = 4%. Speed 20.73 mB/s

Extracted 1 file, 390,911,469 => 209,715,200 bytes. Ratio 186.40%
Extraction time: cpu 0.63 sec/real 8.06 sec = 8%. Speed 26.03 mB/s

The final result is for you to find out.
