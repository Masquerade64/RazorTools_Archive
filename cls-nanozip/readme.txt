CLS-Nanozip: Preview
https://www.fileforums.com/showthread.php?t=97962

Hi guys, you might have noticed I have been creating a lot of CLS plugins for Freearc, it seems like for any compressor that I have in mind, well I have been trying on nanozip the only problem is the overall result hasn't been that effective, either the final size is affected badly or progress via Inno Setup or CMD window takes long to reflect dude to the fact that nanozip gives back false data when I try to steal(take) data from it while it is processing then end up with CRC error.

I gave it one last chance today then Panker told me something tragic, the creator is no longer with us which is why it isn't getting further updates however we decided that we must not give up on trying to make cls even if it doesn't work the way it is supposed to. Which is why I came up with the idea to try and give the message through to the user about the progress of the installation/unpacking process. (Not really sad because of no more updates, which is what most repackers would be sad of)

What I did was since it takes long to make reflections of the progress of nanozip was to make a cls that displays a GUI that shows the progress because at least I was able to figure out its progress.

So far progress is: 90%, the 10% is because after Inno Setup has used the CLS it crashes but anyways, I uploaded a few screenshots to show you guys how it looks like.
