CLS-PrecompMT (Multi tasking)
https://www.fileforums.com/showthread.php?t=97961

Hello guys, again.

Made another CLS based on the one I did about a week ago.

Which you can find here:

What I did this time is made the cls launches parallel instances of precomp.exe to speed up the entire process.

Notes:
During compression, it launches the same number of instances as the number of threads your processor has and during decompression, it launches half that number.

cls name being cls-precompmt.dll, does not mean the executables must also be precompmt.exe and so on, I just renamed the cls but maintained its usage to precomp with the filenames precomp.exe and precomp64.exe for 64-bit.

precomp versions supported:
0.38-0.46

Enjoy
