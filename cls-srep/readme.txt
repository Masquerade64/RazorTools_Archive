CLS-Srep

Hey, tired of greeting y'all with new CLS every time.

Here's another one but for SREP.

Absolutely no drawbacks, you can choose to use CLS for compression and/or decompression.

From my perspectives, it has absolutely no important advantages over the one done by ProFrager but maybe if it runs the srep64.exe there could be some.

It only has one advantage though, it launches srep.exe if system is x86 and if srep64.exe is not present but if you're a 64-bit user and have srep64.exe nearby, it will use it and 64-bit gives that 30% or so boost I think...

Enjoy!
