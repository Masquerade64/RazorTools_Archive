pLZ4 (LZ4 Precompressor) - Test
https://www.fileforums.com/showthread.php?t=98526

Some program I was working on before exam time, this took a day to make, what I noticed is sometimes it gives good ratio and sometimes it doesn't, will properly work on it once I'm free.

Tested on a few Frostbite 3 games such as Battlefield 4, Need For Speed Rivals, also works on Infinity Ward games such as COD MW Remastered or Infinite Warfare, however sometimes you get negative ratio when pLZ4 because of different LZ4 settings and public release version and because of xdelta but like I said, it still needs some work.
