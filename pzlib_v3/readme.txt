pZLib v3 (Final release)

Here's a Christmas gift people, I wonder what vultures have for me though.

Anyways nothing more I can do to this project, it reached its limits in terms of optimisation and offering more speed while producing more or less the same output as precomp, reflate, antiz and etc.

Project was started in July 17, 2016, finished today December 21, 2016. No longer working on this anymore, no more potential updates because everything works, haven't tested on DOOM but it should work to roughly give you 25-27GB output as final size if you compressed it right while giving good speed. pZLib v2 bugs have been fixed as well, tested on PES2017, Mafia 3 and some other games that gave it troubles.

Deal still stands, don't use program if you aren't going to give credits, took 5 months and 4 days to make this.
